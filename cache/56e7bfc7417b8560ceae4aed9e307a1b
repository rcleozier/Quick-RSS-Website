<p>Over the last two decades, collectors James Wagner (<a href="http://www.jameswagner.com/">jameswagner</a>) and Barry Hoggard (<a href="http://www.bloggy.com/">bloggy</a>/<a href="http://www.tristanmedia.com/">Tristan Media LLC</a>) have given a voice to the emerging art scene through their blogs, public events, and co-editing the arts calendar and artists? website hosting service ArtCat (formerly ArtCal.net). Together, they?re known as a force of good in the underrepresented art community, from hosting panel discussions to sitting on benefit committees to inviting artists to their home.</p>
<p>?It?s impossible to get to know the entire New York art world. There are just too many people,? Chris Harding of English Kills Gallery told me on Wednesday. ?But they really try.? Evidencing this, they made the fruits of their labor available to the public in 2010, launching a website for their <a href="http://www.hoggardwagner.com/" target="_blank">entire collection</a>. We thought this was great, and apparently, so did Chris? his show ?Selections from the Hoggard/Wager Collection? <a href="http://www.artcat.com/exhibits/17988" target="_blank">opens tonight</a> at 7 PM at English Kills. Considering the depth of knowledge that?s behind the collection, this should be a survey of underrepresented artists you should know.</p>
<p>In anticipation of tonight?s opening, Barry and James agreed to answer a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>What was your response when Chris asked you about curating a show? Have you ever given any work to a group show before?</strong></p>
<p>Once Chris had explained to us what he wanted to do, we were pretty blown away by his incredibly generous offer. We?ve loaned individual works for artists? solo shows, but we?ve never loaned work for a group show.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe that responsible collecting comes with a certain level of stewardship?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the role of steward is extremely important to us. That includes, first of all, responsibility for caring for the work physically, and then ensuring that it is visible to as many people as possible. The <a href="http://www.hoggardwagner.com/">collection site</a> and the happy phenomenon of this show are both a part of that visibility.  We also try to be diligent about documenting the work, especially as we have found artists themselves, galleries, and estates often have inadequate records. Finally, we believe that collectors should plan for the survival of the art beyond their own life spans, although we haven?t worked that out yet ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Have things changed since you started blogging about art, over a decade ago? Would you say art blogs have brought people together a little bit more? <em>[Founded around 2001, bloggy and jameswagner.com are easily in the running for longest-lasting New York art blogs].</em></strong></p>
<p>When we started, art blogging was generally a field for amateurs?in the sense of not being paid, and of being advocates for emerging art. We think that having to make money from one&#8217;s writing, which is certainly a desirable goal, affects what gets covered on a lot of blogs.</p>
<p>We do think that art blogs are a more important resource for the coverage of emerging artists, galleries, and curators than any of the traditional forms of media, such as magazines or newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>What was the first piece you purchased together? How did you decide to start collecting?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hoggardwagner.com/exhibitions/1/works/1203">Felix Droese?s ?Dresden Yellow II?</a> may have been our first acquisition together.  We purchased it from the artist?s solo show at a non-profit space in the East Village, the New York Kunsthalle, which no longer exists. <em>["Dresden Yellow II" will be on view at English Kills].</em></p>
<p>James had already been collecting on a more modest scale for some ten years when we met, so there was no specific decision to continue doing so as a couple.  Both of us had always been interested in the arts, the visual arts included. James began collecting because he was friends with artists in Rhode Island and later in New York and had gradually realized that, even with a very small amount of money, it was possible to live with their work and that of others.</p>
<p><strong>Would you say there are themes throughout the collection?</strong></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of humor (especially dark humor), but any themes are really by accident based on our pretty eclectic tastes. There was never a plan. Almost everything we own was purchased within an hour of first seeing it.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Is there any work in particular that you are excited to have on view?</strong></p>
<p>I think we would be expected to say that we?re excited to have each of these works exhibited, and it?s true, partly because Chris Harding has done such a wonderful job of curating, but also because pretty much each of the pieces in the collection excites us.</p>
<p>But we?re particularly excited to be able to show <a href="http://www.wipnyc.org/blog/tracey-baran">Tracey Baran</a>?s <a href="http://www.hoggardwagner.com/exhibitions/1/works/1249" target="_blank">?Because I?m a Girl?</a>, both because we love her work and because <a href="http://jameswagner.com/2008/11/tracey_baran.html">her early and tragic death in 2008</a> put an end to what we expected would be a brilliant, long career. We hope that this show will enable others to understand our enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We also think that Teresa Moro?s<a href="http://www.hoggardwagner.com/exhibitions/1/works/1253"> ?Wildlife (series)?</a> represents work which really must be seen by more people. Our love and respect for the three gouaches we own has only intensified since we purchased them from<a href="http://www.foxyproduction.com/exhibition/view/322"> Foxy Production</a> in 2003, and we were delighted to learn that Chris shares our appreciation for the work. We are also very concerned about friends in Spain right now:  Teresa lives with her artist husband and daughter in Madrid.</p>

<p>With a major art festival and the city?s largest art fair, September is the month to be in Copenhagen. We saw a ton of art and we noticed that at least half of the artists were American or non-Danes. Are there not that many Danish artists? Or do Danish collectors just need to get with the program? That being said, we brought back a surprising number of highlights and our travels hit on that one truism of gallery-going: you can find good and bad art no matter where you go.</p>

September 1 &#8211; October 20, 2012</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Corinna:</strong> Hands down, this was the most well-curated show I?ve seen in awhile. The exhibition itself is fairly sparse, with a few video monitors lackadaisically propped up against the wall, a painting here and there, and a few objects planted on the floor. As a whole, the exhibition looks more like an unfinished stage set. Maybe that plays into the curators? idea of their practice as being like running ?modelling agency,? a coarse, but tongue-in-cheek metaphor for saying that they?re actually the ones in charge and the artists are just there to put on a pretty face. At least that?s what I take it to mean.</p>
<p>My favorite works in this exhibition aren?t straightforward art objects; they?re things like Jan S. Hansens?s <em>Sculptural Prop for Info-Screen</em>, a green cloth draped over a metal stand. It just looks good, taking pride of place as the first thing you see when you walk inside the gallery. It?s a portal to another work: the cloth, well, it?s hooked up to a camera that feeds into a flat screen monitor behind the front desk that reads off the exhibition checklist. Included with the checklist is a piechart showing what percentage of the retail value of the work goes to the artists, curators, and dealers. I like that level of transparency, and the corporate presentation that goes along with it. Heck, I?m talking a lot, but I just like this exhibition. Blue ribbon.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Yup. A refreshingly thoughtful work. I didn?t get the impression that the curators were saying the artists aren?t providing the substance. I just thought it meant that when image-selecting becomes a popular art and social practice, the distinction between curator and artist isn?t so rigid anymore.</p>
<p>There?s a rack of pamphlets in the back labelled ?Modeling Agency,? with a photo of the curators crouching on a low platform against a sparse backdrop of photos. It?s not quite filled-up enough to be a showroom, and a little more antiseptic than a typical art piece. The pamphlet text describes how everyone who engages with social media filters the internet to ?model a subjective expression of their relationship to society.?</p>
<p>That?s what I thought it aimed to show us in screens-within-screens, a poem for Julian Assange, and the inclusion of <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRGko9XXB6U">Introducing Male 3D Model Michael 5 for GenesisTM</a></em>, a demo reel of ?the most versatile, realistic, and anatomically accurate male human figure ever made available for public use? in the GenesisTM 3D Model Platform. The scrolling close-ups of skin, hair, poses, range of lifestyle options, all seem to suggest a more realistic reality makes a more perfect reality. There are many facetious versions of the ?self-reflexive-infinite-lens? cliche, but this went deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> That was one of my favorite works in the show, presenting that dream of digital, modifiable perfection. I need to post that video on YouTube for the rest of the world. [And then Whitney showed me it?s already on YouTube. I?m a loser.]</p>

August 31 &#8211; October 13, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Showroom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> The showroom in the back isn?t a curated show, but we thought we should mention the work. It includes a bunch of New York regulars?Dave Shrigley, Jeppe Hein, and Elmgreen &amp; Dragset. It?s not really curated, but a few works have to do with cutting up space. Alexander Tovborg?s <em>Triptykon (Blue I)</em> is a beautiful, planar cross-section of a house, next to Chris Johanson?s <em>Co-exist in Exist</em>, a collage stack of colored plastic bottles which melt into painted shard shapes. Jeppe Hein?s hanging oval mirror reflects those works, and he?s cut slits into mirror canvases. Even if it was random, I thought those worked off each other. It was okay.</p>
<p>Not as crazy about the ceramic Elmgreen &amp; Dragset cooler in the back and their photos of classical statues of boys wearing a jock strap and a wife beater. Here they just felt like boutique items. Maybe curation could fix these, but if it has to come to that, they&#8217;re just not very compelling artworks. <strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I just liked this random grouping of artists because it was more vibrant and punchy than the work in the other rooms. Not really a show, but it felt like one. And yeah, I?m kind of over the neo-Classical style that Elmgreen &amp; Dragset is into, along with a lot of that VVORK-kind of stuff that?s come out since E &amp; D started doing it.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Joachim Koester, <em>Some Boarded Up Houses</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Joachim Koester has filled the second room with three sets of photos. The first, <em>Occupied Plots, Abandoned Futures</em>, depicts cheap roadside storefronts and empty lots in blue collar neighborhoods. The next shows deteriorating urban mansions, just a day beyond repair. The third show us exteriors and interiors of Alamut Castle, a ruin in Iran with upside-down captions from <em>Time of the Hashashin</em>, a 19th century story set in a hash club.</p>
<p>The captions describe scenes of moving between spaces and from dark to light, under photos of dual spaces: scaffolding around a slab of rock, or a ladder ascending into a dark upper-level, inside the cave-like castle.</p>
<p>That, and a photo of a crystal ball on the back wall made me think that this isn?t about houses at all, but crossing thresholds. I actually thought he captured an aura which unfolded really intuitively here, whereas all sensitivity gets buried in his concurrent solo exhibition at Kunsthal Charlottenborg.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I didn?t love this when I walked in: I saw boarded up houses that screamed social-documentary meets Ed Ruscha. Borrring. It was Koester?s <em>Time of the Hashashin</em> series that warmed me up to his work, just because those photographs of the Alamut Castle had an air of magic and drama that his <em>Occupied Plots, Abandoned Futures</em> series lacked. I kept on thinking about Xanadu.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Jesper Just, <em>This Nameless Spectacle</em></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><strong>Whitney: </strong></strong>Was not impressed with Jesper Just?s panoramic dual-projections. It opens with a woman in a wheelchair moving through outdoor spaces; as we see shots of her on the right-wall screen, we see what she sees on the left-wall screen.</p>
<p>This made for a handful of gratuitous shots. For some reason, she rolls through a cave with a waterfall in it, which looks pretty impressive on the big screen.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>She reaches an apartment complex and is followed by a young guy, who we later find out lives a few stories up in the tower across from her. Once inside her own apartment, she gets up and walks to the window, where the boy (now shirtless) tilts his window to shine light in her eyes. She squints into it for a minute, then starts writhing on the floor. A long and intense staring exchange follows. He?s made a series of very specific events and blown them up on a huge scale; inevitably, whatever happens appears to carry really serious meaning. I didn?t see any.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I agree that Jesper Just isn?t making meaningful work, but I think he?s good at creating compelling, mysterious vignettes. He wants to be Hitchcock, so maybe he?s taken up the wrong line of work. About that ?writhing around? scene: I dug it. There?s a guy who shines a light into the eyes of his neighbor, which causes her, for no good reason at all, to tumble to the carpet, drooling in an epileptic fit. It?s pretty scary/sexy. As for Just?s reasons and motives for the physical installation of the work, yeah, there?s no reason why the work needs to be on such a large-scale, or two-channel, but that doesn?t bother me so much.</p>

<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> This show was pretty hit-or-miss, but it showed work by emerging Danish artists, and prior to this weekend, I knew nothing about that territory. As for the hits, there was Fisse, a 19-second-long video by Naja Maria Lundstrøm that was just long enough to make a joke: a woman walks up to an older couple, asking the man if his girlfriend wants some pussy. He says ?no.?<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>Lars Worm?s showed some simple canvases, marked by just a few lines of spray paint here and there, that border on interior design, but they were pleasant enough. And then I liked Jytte Høy?s <em>Twist and Shout</em>, a box containing wooden a model hand, the type you?d find at Blick, with its fingers contorted back-and-forth. It made me go ?Ow.?<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>As for the misses, I?ll include Christian Lemmerz?s <em>OTTO (P.M.)</em>, a bronze bicycle helmet pinned to the wall that looked exactly like a bicycle helmet, and Peter Bonde?s <em>Fuck Younger Painters</em>, a painting with a poster on it that says, unsurprisingly,  ?Fuck Younger Painters?. These two works were far too obvious. Guys, just learn some subtlety. Just a little bit. Even with my reservations, the misses weren?t too bad; none of these works would be out of place at one of New York?s independent art fairs.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Apparently this is a venue mostly for student work, so it may explain the loose premise. It did feel pretty art fair-y, which I don?t think makes for much of an art experience. It was nice to see a bunch of Danish artists, though.</p>

<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> This artist?s work looked totally familiar to me. No surprise, I asked the gallerist about him, and he?s based in Brooklyn and shows at Casey Kaplan. Out of the four Carlsberg galleries we visited, this was the only artist we saw from our neck of the woods. He?s really talented at paying attention to detail: all of his surreal sculptures have been carved with an immense amount of decoration and ornamentation. There?s one sculpture that looks like a human-sized lamp outfitted with wooden mushrooms and oversized, dangling dicks. For as many dicks and ?anal beads? in this show, it?s not a sexy show. I guess that has something to do with how there?s also a lot of death in this show, too, with some of his sculptures looking like mummified corpses.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> It?s installed in a yoga studio set-up with rows of funky pods, altars, and a wiry menora, like something out of <em>Beetlejuice</em>. Weirdly in keeping with that film, there?s a Circle of Life theme, with the mummy-pods (which appear to be smoking long pipes) and p&amp;v shapes throughout. The result isn?t exactly a commandment, just a quiet reminder about fucking and dying. Which we get a lot.</p>

August 24 &#8211; October 20, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I have nothing good to say about these two shows, which featured some monochromatic figurative work by Janaina Tschäpe and then, most notably, a huge propeller with text projected on it. There?s a big sign that says to stay away from the propeller or your head might get chopped off. If only that had been part of the installation&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> What about the Jonathan Meese bathroom, with a neon-splashed mirror across from the toilet? There?s a video of Meese sitting on a toilet, singing ?Me-ta-bo-is-mus? (metabolism) over and over in a high-pitched voice, pinching a block of white clay, and then throwing it in the bowl. You see yourself sitting on the toilet, too, and you kind of complete the work with your own metabolismus. Weee!!! It?s a level of engagement that I truly wish art would offer more.</p>
<p>I know it seemed cheesy, but I liked that propeller. A series of spiralling quotes from astronauts are projected onto it, about what it?s like to fully realize that you?re in space. They describe being disconnected from any frame of reference, time, history, or place. I think it?s worthwhile to really think about what that means occasionally.</p>
<p>Janaina Tschäpe seemed to be getting at something similar with balloons floating in water and a video of a giant white beach ball drifting on shallow waves. This just didn?t carry as much impact (even if there hadn&#8217;t been a giant propeller in the other room).</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> How could I forget the Meese bathroom? And the attention to detail in the cluttered bathroom! Like the gallerist told us, Meese adds something new to his installation each time. I bet there?s some long lines for the bathroom during openings.</p>

<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> It may not look like much, but I really enjoyed reading Ed Templeton?s handwritten captions around his photos. I liked the combinations of first impressions (photos of people on the street) with captions we?ve heard before. Some of them contradict, like above and beneath a photo of an old woman begging for change:</p>
<p>?As a small businessperson, you have no greater leverage than the truth.&#8221;&#8211;John Greenleaf</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>?The surest way to remain poor is to be an honest man.&#8221; &#8212; Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Others took on a funny inner dialogue, like a bathroom stall conversation:</p>
<p>?Woman was God?s second mistake.&#8221;&#8211; Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<p>followed by</p>
<p>?Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal.?&#8211; Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Meh. It was pretty much a skater art show, which is not something I?m really into. Sorry, but I?ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Any kind of art can be good, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Yep, but not this time around.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><br />

<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Corinna:</strong> Hands down, this was the most well-curated show I?ve seen in awhile. The exhibition itself is fairly sparse, with a few video monitors lackadaisically propped up against the wall, a painting here and there, and a few objects planted on the floor. As a whole, the exhibition looks more like an unfinished stage set. Maybe that plays into the curators? idea of their practice as being like running ?modelling agency,? a coarse, but tongue-in-cheek metaphor for saying that they?re actually the ones in charge and the artists are just there to put on a pretty face. At least that?s what I take it to mean.</p>
<p>My favorite works in this exhibition aren?t straightforward art objects; they?re things like Jan S. Hansens?s <em>Sculptural Prop for Info-Screen</em>, a green cloth draped over a metal stand. It just looks good, taking pride of place as the first thing you see when you walk inside the gallery. It?s a portal to another work: the cloth, well, it?s hooked up to a camera that feeds into a flat screen monitor behind the front desk that reads off the exhibition checklist. Included with the checklist is a piechart showing what percentage of the retail value of the work goes to the artists, curators, and dealers. I like that level of transparency, and the corporate presentation that goes along with it. Heck, I?m talking a lot, but I just like this exhibition. Blue ribbon.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Yup. A refreshingly thoughtful work. I didn?t get the impression that the curators were saying the artists aren?t providing the substance. I just thought it meant that when image-selecting becomes a popular art and social practice, the distinction between curator and artist isn?t so rigid anymore.</p>
<p>There?s a rack of pamphlets in the back labelled ?Modeling Agency,? with a photo of the curators crouching on a low platform against a sparse backdrop of photos. It?s not quite filled-up enough to be a showroom, and a little more antiseptic than a typical art piece. The pamphlet text describes how everyone who engages with social media filters the internet to ?model a subjective expression of their relationship to society.?</p>
<p>That?s what I thought it aimed to show us in screens-within-screens, a poem for Julian Assange, and the inclusion of <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRGko9XXB6U">Introducing Male 3D Model Michael 5 for GenesisTM</a></em>, a demo reel of ?the most versatile, realistic, and anatomically accurate male human figure ever made available for public use? in the GenesisTM 3D Model Platform. The scrolling close-ups of skin, hair, poses, range of lifestyle options, all seem to suggest a more realistic reality makes a more perfect reality. There are many facetious versions of the ?self-reflexive-infinite-lens? cliche, but this went deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> That was one of my favorite works in the show, presenting that dream of digital, modifiable perfection. I need to post that video on YouTube for the rest of the world. [And then Whitney showed me it?s already on YouTube. I?m a loser.]</p>

<p><strong>Showroom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> The showroom in the back isn?t a curated show, but we thought we should mention the work. It includes a bunch of New York regulars?Dave Shrigley, Jeppe Hein, and Elmgreen &amp; Dragset. It?s not really curated, but a few works have to do with cutting up space. Alexander Tovborg?s <em>Triptykon (Blue I)</em> is a beautiful, planar cross-section of a house, next to Chris Johanson?s <em>Co-exist in Exist</em>, a collage stack of colored plastic bottles which melt into painted shard shapes. Jeppe Hein?s hanging oval mirror reflects those works, and he?s cut slits into mirror canvases. Even if it was random, I thought those worked off each other. It was okay.</p>
<p>Not as crazy about the ceramic Elmgreen &amp; Dragset cooler in the back and their photos of classical statues of boys wearing a jock strap and a wife beater. Here they just felt like boutique items. Maybe curation could fix these, but if it has to come to that, they&#8217;re just not very compelling artworks. <strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I just liked this random grouping of artists because it was more vibrant and punchy than the work in the other rooms. Not really a show, but it felt like one. And yeah, I?m kind of over the neo-Classical style that Elmgreen &amp; Dragset is into, along with a lot of that VVORK-kind of stuff that?s come out since E &amp; D started doing it.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Joachim Koester, <em>Some Boarded Up Houses</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Joachim Koester has filled the second room with three sets of photos. The first, <em>Occupied Plots, Abandoned Futures</em>, depicts cheap roadside storefronts and empty lots in blue collar neighborhoods. The next shows deteriorating urban mansions, just a day beyond repair. The third show us exteriors and interiors of Alamut Castle, a ruin in Iran with upside-down captions from <em>Time of the Hashashin</em>, a 19th century story set in a hash club.</p>
<p>The captions describe scenes of moving between spaces and from dark to light, under photos of dual spaces: scaffolding around a slab of rock, or a ladder ascending into a dark upper-level, inside the cave-like castle.</p>
<p>That, and a photo of a crystal ball on the back wall made me think that this isn?t about houses at all, but crossing thresholds. I actually thought he captured an aura which unfolded really intuitively here, whereas all sensitivity gets buried in his concurrent solo exhibition at Kunsthal Charlottenborg.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I didn?t love this when I walked in: I saw boarded up houses that screamed social-documentary meets Ed Ruscha. Borrring. It was Koester?s <em>Time of the Hashashin</em> series that warmed me up to his work, just because those photographs of the Alamut Castle had an air of magic and drama that his <em>Occupied Plots, Abandoned Futures</em> series lacked. I kept on thinking about Xanadu.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717">Jesper Just, <em>This Nameless Spectacle</em></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><strong>Whitney: </strong></strong>Was not impressed with Jesper Just?s panoramic dual-projections. It opens with a woman in a wheelchair moving through outdoor spaces; as we see shots of her on the right-wall screen, we see what she sees on the left-wall screen.</p>
<p>This made for a handful of gratuitous shots. For some reason, she rolls through a cave with a waterfall in it, which looks pretty impressive on the big screen.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>She reaches an apartment complex and is followed by a young guy, who we later find out lives a few stories up in the tower across from her. Once inside her own apartment, she gets up and walks to the window, where the boy (now shirtless) tilts his window to shine light in her eyes. She squints into it for a minute, then starts writhing on the floor. A long and intense staring exchange follows. He?s made a series of very specific events and blown them up on a huge scale; inevitably, whatever happens appears to carry really serious meaning. I didn?t see any.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I agree that Jesper Just isn?t making meaningful work, but I think he?s good at creating compelling, mysterious vignettes. He wants to be Hitchcock, so maybe he?s taken up the wrong line of work. About that ?writhing around? scene: I dug it. There?s a guy who shines a light into the eyes of his neighbor, which causes her, for no good reason at all, to tumble to the carpet, drooling in an epileptic fit. It?s pretty scary/sexy. As for Just?s reasons and motives for the physical installation of the work, yeah, there?s no reason why the work needs to be on such a large-scale, or two-channel, but that doesn?t bother me so much.</p>

<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> This show was pretty hit-or-miss, but it showed work by emerging Danish artists, and prior to this weekend, I knew nothing about that territory. As for the hits, there was Fisse, a 19-second-long video by Naja Maria Lundstrøm that was just long enough to make a joke: a woman walks up to an older couple, asking the man if his girlfriend wants some pussy. He says ?no.?<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>Lars Worm?s showed some simple canvases, marked by just a few lines of spray paint here and there, that border on interior design, but they were pleasant enough. And then I liked Jytte Høy?s <em>Twist and Shout</em>, a box containing wooden a model hand, the type you?d find at Blick, with its fingers contorted back-and-forth. It made me go ?Ow.?<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p>As for the misses, I?ll include Christian Lemmerz?s <em>OTTO (P.M.)</em>, a bronze bicycle helmet pinned to the wall that looked exactly like a bicycle helmet, and Peter Bonde?s <em>Fuck Younger Painters</em>, a painting with a poster on it that says, unsurprisingly,  ?Fuck Younger Painters?. These two works were far too obvious. Guys, just learn some subtlety. Just a little bit. Even with my reservations, the misses weren?t too bad; none of these works would be out of place at one of New York?s independent art fairs.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Apparently this is a venue mostly for student work, so it may explain the loose premise. It did feel pretty art fair-y, which I don?t think makes for much of an art experience. It was nice to see a bunch of Danish artists, though.</p>

<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> This artist?s work looked totally familiar to me. No surprise, I asked the gallerist about him, and he?s based in Brooklyn and shows at Casey Kaplan. Out of the four Carlsberg galleries we visited, this was the only artist we saw from our neck of the woods. He?s really talented at paying attention to detail: all of his surreal sculptures have been carved with an immense amount of decoration and ornamentation. There?s one sculpture that looks like a human-sized lamp outfitted with wooden mushrooms and oversized, dangling dicks. For as many dicks and ?anal beads? in this show, it?s not a sexy show. I guess that has something to do with how there?s also a lot of death in this show, too, with some of his sculptures looking like mummified corpses.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> It?s installed in a yoga studio set-up with rows of funky pods, altars, and a wiry menora, like something out of <em>Beetlejuice</em>. Weirdly in keeping with that film, there?s a Circle of Life theme, with the mummy-pods (which appear to be smoking long pipes) and p&amp;v shapes throughout. The result isn?t exactly a commandment, just a quiet reminder about fucking and dying. Which we get a lot.</p>

August 24 &#8211; October 20, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> I have nothing good to say about these two shows, which featured some monochromatic figurative work by Janaina Tschäpe and then, most notably, a huge propeller with text projected on it. There?s a big sign that says to stay away from the propeller or your head might get chopped off. If only that had been part of the installation&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> What about the Jonathan Meese bathroom, with a neon-splashed mirror across from the toilet? There?s a video of Meese sitting on a toilet, singing ?Me-ta-bo-is-mus? (metabolism) over and over in a high-pitched voice, pinching a block of white clay, and then throwing it in the bowl. You see yourself sitting on the toilet, too, and you kind of complete the work with your own metabolismus. Weee!!! It?s a level of engagement that I truly wish art would offer more.</p>
<p>I know it seemed cheesy, but I liked that propeller. A series of spiralling quotes from astronauts are projected onto it, about what it?s like to fully realize that you?re in space. They describe being disconnected from any frame of reference, time, history, or place. I think it?s worthwhile to really think about what that means occasionally.</p>
<p>Janaina Tschäpe seemed to be getting at something similar with balloons floating in water and a video of a giant white beach ball drifting on shallow waves. This just didn?t carry as much impact (even if there hadn&#8217;t been a giant propeller in the other room).</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> How could I forget the Meese bathroom? And the attention to detail in the cluttered bathroom! Like the gallerist told us, Meese adds something new to his installation each time. I bet there?s some long lines for the bathroom during openings.</p>

<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> It may not look like much, but I really enjoyed reading Ed Templeton?s handwritten captions around his photos. I liked the combinations of first impressions (photos of people on the street) with captions we?ve heard before. Some of them contradict, like above and beneath a photo of an old woman begging for change:</p>
<p>?As a small businessperson, you have no greater leverage than the truth.&#8221;&#8211;John Greenleaf</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>?The surest way to remain poor is to be an honest man.&#8221; &#8212; Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Others took on a funny inner dialogue, like a bathroom stall conversation:</p>
<p>?Woman was God?s second mistake.&#8221;&#8211; Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<p>followed by</p>
<p>?Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal.?&#8211; Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Meh. It was pretty much a skater art show, which is not something I?m really into. Sorry, but I?ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>Whitney:</strong> Any kind of art can be good, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Yep, but not this time around.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6843908322043717"><br />

<p>Our seven gallery girls have gotten comfortable in their roles on the show, shrugging off their dead-end art-related responsibilities for the subsidized gossip that keeps the show running. As the gargantuan art fair Art Basel approaches, they drag themselves to Miami kicking and screaming, literally coming to tears when faced with the idea of being productive.</p>
<p>The episode opens with Amy getting fired from Sharon Hurowitz?s art advisory; this is no surprise after Amy tried to force all of her work onto Kerri and embarrassed Sharon with her habitual lateness. With drama and unemployment at record highs within the Gallery Girls social circle, Jane Holzer fears for the show?s sustainability. She takes Amy, Claudia, and Angela up to the Brant Foundation to see David Altmejd?s <a href="http://www.brantfoundation.org/assets/media/presskit/DAVID_ALTMEJD.pdf" target="_blank">sculpture</a>, so that maybe someone will talk about art or associate with Amy. Claudia finds the work ?individual? and ?thought-about?; Angela gazes into a mirror. Inspirational music lets us know that the girls have understood the art.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.17785267066210508"><br />

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, whatever it looks great?now can we talk about Amy?s date with Eli?</p>
</div>
<p>Liz is pushing the ?my father doesn?t love me? bit again. Her father, collector Martin Margulies hasn?t planned a family vacation this year (the monster), and Liz suspects that he is distant toward her due to her earlier self-destructive behavior. ?Daddy issues? fueled most of the emotional drama in Work of Art?s second season, running the sad father story gamut from divorce to cancer to jet-ski accidents. It?s obvious that Bravo?s producers are trying to wring out a similar woeful tale, but if sending a private car to pick Liz up from the airport is substandard parenting, as she claims, then I have some serious thinking to do.</p>
<p>Eli Klein is having a pre-Basel party at his apartment, and Liz criticizes him for just wanting to show off his apartment and art collection. Before we can explore the true spirit of partying in all its altruism and purity, Liz stirs the pot by inviting Angela to breakfast at her father?s Miami warehouse to the exclusion of Chantal and Claudia. Some half-baked insults are thrown around: Liz refers to Chantal and Claudia as ?Dumb and Dumber,? Chantal thinks that Liz is a bitch, and Liz?s boyfriend Bobby gestures to ?the little baby Asian people,? which we?re going to assume is a five-episode-late comment on Eli?s <a href="http://ekfineart.com/artist/Han_Yajuan/works/" target="_blank">Han Yajuan</a> show.</p>
<p>Back at End of Century, Chantal and Claudia discuss the prospect of a pop-up gallery at Art Basel. Chantal is reduced to tears at the idea, as it will interfere with her vacation (which just happens to be in Miami for the duration of Art Basel). Amy has offered End of Century their pick of venues, and Claudia?s skills as an art dealer have left her with plenty of unsold art, but Chantal is too worried about the logistics of finding coat racks for their garments in Miami (instead of just showing their art, like one might do at Art Basel). Chantal reduces Claudia?s plan to ?bringing a few things down that are beachy and trying to sell them? because the fair is in Miami and must therefore be beach-themed. Chantal?s protests don?t work on everybody; Angela still has the photos from her show and they?re coming to Miami whether we like it or not.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.17785267066210508"><br />

</div>
<p>The three Brooklyn girls arrive in Miami and terrorize the locals with their abominable swimwear. Claudia and Angela urge Chantal to be on board with the pop-up gallery, because in true gallery girl fashion, they?ve already been blabbing about the show to their peers and can?t back out now. The rest of the cast have also made their way to Miami: Liz has had her genitals waxed because, again, Art Basel is beach-themed, and Maggie discusses her own father?s pioneering work with neon. Sharon Hurowitz shows now-lone intern Kerri a Gert and Uwe Tobias woodcut, which is good since its scale is ?something that is really special.? Now that one gallery girl has seen one piece of art at the fair, this is enough Art Basel for the Art Basel episode and we can go back to Liz feeling neglected when her father is busy during the busiest time of the year for him.</p>
<p>Amy shows off her family?s Miami home to the Brooklyn girls. Amy acts professionally as a foil to the EoC girls? insolence, laying out offers for venues to put End of Century in the fair?s art walk while Claudia gnaws on a cigar and Chantal insults her coffee. The group goes to visit the best two leads: the Rosario Bond studio?s massive white-walled gallery space is no good as the other art displayed is too colorful and art-like, but Cafeina is a hit because Claudia likes their drinks. The venue does not, however, have walls or lighting.</p>
<p>The episode?s final showdown occurs at an event at the Margulies Collection at the Warehouse. All three Brooklyn girls show up despite Liz?s Angela-only invitation, dressed so bizarrely as to attract laughter from passersby. All fail to initiate basic greetings. The girls safely back in their cliques, Claudia starts bashing Liz for wearing human-appropriate clothing.</p>

<p>Our seven gallery girls have gotten comfortable in their roles on the show, shrugging off their dead-end art-related responsibilities for the subsidized gossip that keeps the show running. As the gargantuan art fair Art Basel approaches, they drag themselves to Miami kicking and screaming, literally coming to tears when faced with the idea of being productive.</p>
<p>The episode opens with Amy getting fired from Sharon Hurowitz?s art advisory; this is no surprise after Amy tried to force all of her work onto Kerri and embarrassed Sharon with her habitual lateness. With drama and unemployment at record highs within the Gallery Girls social circle, Jane Holzer fears for the show?s sustainability. She takes Amy, Claudia, and Angela up to the Brant Foundation to see David Altmejd?s <a href="http://www.brantfoundation.org/assets/media/presskit/DAVID_ALTMEJD.pdf" target="_blank">sculpture</a>, so that maybe someone will talk about art or associate with Amy. Claudia finds the work ?individual? and ?thought-about?; Angela gazes into a mirror. Inspirational music lets us know that the girls have understood the art.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.17785267066210508"><br />

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, whatever it looks great?now can we talk about Amy?s date with Eli?</p>
</div>
<p>Liz is pushing the ?my father doesn?t love me? bit again. Her father, collector Martin Margulies hasn?t planned a family vacation this year (the monster), and Liz suspects that he is distant toward her due to her earlier self-destructive behavior. ?Daddy issues? fueled most of the emotional drama in Work of Art?s second season, running the sad father story gamut from divorce to cancer to jet-ski accidents. It?s obvious that Bravo?s producers are trying to wring out a similar woeful tale, but if sending a private car to pick Liz up from the airport is substandard parenting, as she claims, then I have some serious thinking to do.</p>
<p>Eli Klein is having a pre-Basel party at his apartment, and Liz criticizes him for just wanting to show off his apartment and art collection. Before we can explore the true spirit of partying in all its altruism and purity, Liz stirs the pot by inviting Angela to breakfast at her father?s Miami warehouse to the exclusion of Chantal and Claudia. Some half-baked insults are thrown around: Liz refers to Chantal and Claudia as ?Dumb and Dumber,? Chantal thinks that Liz is a bitch, and Liz?s boyfriend Bobby gestures to ?the little baby Asian people,? which we?re going to assume is a five-episode-late comment on Eli?s <a href="http://ekfineart.com/artist/Han_Yajuan/works/" target="_blank">Han Yajuan</a> show.</p>
<p>Back at End of Century, Chantal and Claudia discuss the prospect of a pop-up gallery at Art Basel. Chantal is reduced to tears at the idea, as it will interfere with her vacation (which just happens to be in Miami for the duration of Art Basel). Amy has offered End of Century their pick of venues, and Claudia?s skills as an art dealer have left her with plenty of unsold art, but Chantal is too worried about the logistics of finding coat racks for their garments in Miami (instead of just showing their art, like one might do at Art Basel). Chantal reduces Claudia?s plan to ?bringing a few things down that are beachy and trying to sell them? because the fair is in Miami and must therefore be beach-themed. Chantal?s protests don?t work on everybody; Angela still has the photos from her show and they?re coming to Miami whether we like it or not.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.17785267066210508"><br />

	<p class="wp-caption-text">?We can definitely tell that we?re not any part of the local flavor.? ?Claudia</p>
</div>
<p>The three Brooklyn girls arrive in Miami and terrorize the locals with their abominable swimwear. Claudia and Angela urge Chantal to be on board with the pop-up gallery, because in true gallery girl fashion, they?ve already been blabbing about the show to their peers and can?t back out now. The rest of the cast have also made their way to Miami: Liz has had her genitals waxed because, again, Art Basel is beach-themed, and Maggie discusses her own father?s pioneering work with neon. Sharon Hurowitz shows now-lone intern Kerri a Gert and Uwe Tobias woodcut, which is good since its scale is ?something that is really special.? Now that one gallery girl has seen one piece of art at the fair, this is enough Art Basel for the Art Basel episode and we can go back to Liz feeling neglected when her father is busy during the busiest time of the year for him.</p>
<p>Amy shows off her family?s Miami home to the Brooklyn girls. Amy acts professionally as a foil to the EoC girls? insolence, laying out offers for venues to put End of Century in the fair?s art walk while Claudia gnaws on a cigar and Chantal insults her coffee. The group goes to visit the best two leads: the Rosario Bond studio?s massive white-walled gallery space is no good as the other art displayed is too colorful and art-like, but Cafeina is a hit because Claudia likes their drinks. The venue does not, however, have walls or lighting.</p>
<p>The episode?s final showdown occurs at an event at the Margulies Collection at the Warehouse. All three Brooklyn girls show up despite Liz?s Angela-only invitation, dressed so bizarrely as to attract laughter from passersby. All fail to initiate basic greetings. The girls safely back in their cliques, Claudia starts bashing Liz for wearing human-appropriate clothing.</p>

<p>In 1999, I moved from Canada to the United States to go to grad school. As many foreign students do, I stayed  in the U.S. after I finished my degree in 2001 and thus needed a work visa.  It was around that time that I met <a href="http://www.waxlaw.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Waxman,</a> an immigration lawyer who put together the paperwork for the jobs I took.</p>
<p>Nathan is awesome. He makes immigration and paperwork sound fascinating, not frightening, and he can talk about art with the best of them. So, I figured I&#8217;d sit down with him and Susu Durst, an Extraordinary Ability Specialist who works at his firm. I asked them to get me up to speed on the lastest immigration news for artists, and chat a little about what artists need to do to immigrate to the U.S. We spoke about all that, and even ended up discussing how the differences in Canadian and American culture have informed immigration policy. It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Paddy Johnson:</strong> If you live overseas, and you?re an artist or want to work in the arts, do you think the task of getting a work visa should feel daunting to you?</p>
<p><strong>Susu Durst</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Waxman</strong>: Especially not for artists.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: We?ve done a bunch of DJ?s and musicians. It?s really only actors who have a tough time&#8230;especially stage actors.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They?ve made it easier for artists and harder for actors; that?s because actors have organizations that protect them from foreign competition. Artists Equity is particularly protectionist.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: I take it we?re talking about O visas here, visas issued for extraordinary ability.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The O is a visa for non-immigrants. In other words, it?s not a green card but it could conceivably allow artists or entertainers to remain in the U.S. indefinitely, by obtaining extensions. The initial O-1 visa may last up to three years, with the potential for indefinite extensions. Last year or the year before, there was lots of discussion about the O visa in the arts, especially acting, becoming exceptionally difficult because [Immigration] was enforcing the itinerary requirement. What this means is that Immigration wants to know what you?re actually going to be doing. The problem is, we have had actor clients who are really major, major figures and easily meet the O standard, but who don?t have any work. In the past, the O had been used as a way of coming to the U.S. to get work. Since the service has really cracked down on that, it?s been a real problem for a lot of our overseas actors. It?s the cart before the horse problem: they need to get here to audition, but if we just say they are auditioning, the case will be denied.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: The one thing that has changed in the last 6 to 9 months is that the adjudication process for O visas has been way, way faster. It only takes two weeks by regular process to get a good case through.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Two weeks? What?s changed?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I?m guessing that they hired more people, and when they run out of H?s they have lots of people left in places like Vermont who have nothing to do, so the O-1s get done quickly.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What is an H visa?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It?s a temporary professional visa for a job requiring, at minimum, a university degree. Unfortunately, it?s numerically limited and new petitions tend to be exhausted by late spring or early summer. H&#8217;s, unlike O&#8217;s, contemplate a traditional employer/employee relationship and must be compensated at appropriate US wage levels.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What about J-1s? Those are intern and student visas.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They are primarily for interns and trainees. The problem with the J-1 is that it is limited to 12 to 18 months, so by the time you?re here it?s over. And then many of those people are stranded, because there aren?t any H-1s left for someone who?s not in an H-1 position, or who just doesn?t qualify for an O. The J-1 really is relatively easy to get because of its short-term nature, but it?s not so attractive for so many people. But it certainly would be ideal for someone who just wants the experience of working in Los Angeles or New York for a year.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Does it seem like it might be a good place to get enough experience to qualify for an O?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It might be. It some cases it makes sense. If you?re Canadian you may qualify for a TN1 [a temporary work visa]. But it represents a dead end, and people on TN1 visas may wind up being stranded with no status. So we have to be cautious about recommending it to people, because once a TN?s 18 months is up, if there are no H-1s available, and the TN isn?t likely to succeed as an O-1 petitioner, there?s no way for him or her to stay, other than marriage.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: That?s really too bad.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Well, the system developed over many decades, in a random way, so that there are winners and losers and it?s never represented any kind of systematic thought; I think people being stranded is kind of inevitable, as a result of the patchwork nature of the system.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: But maybe what you?re thinking about more is artists and people in the arts, and we?ve been doing some interesting cases. Right now, we have a pending case on behalf of a girl who is supposed to be working at MoMA PS1.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Curating, and performance art. She?s a performance artist and also a curator, and we?ve received a request for additional evidence.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Which is what happened with me, when I was applying for my green card.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Right, and we responded, and it was promptly approved.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: So is that for a green card or an O visa?</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: An O visa.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: She?s kind of a junior person, she?s not quite at the seniority that you had when you applied for a green card.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: But she?s also kind of at the border of two fields, of curating and performance art. We have a chronic problem with explaining performance art to Immigration. It?s in art forms that represent a synthesis of existing media where we encounter problems. Immigration tends to think in very traditional terms of ?Well, what gallery is it in? What museum is it in? Has <em>The New York Times</em> talked about it??</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: It?s interesting that while the art world really trumpets this idea of blurring boundaries, the very things that make the arts unique and extraordinary are also the things that make an immigration case challenging.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: We?re dealing with immigration adjudicators who are generally well-meaning civil servants, but who are in little boxes, literally working in little cubicles from 8:30 to 4:30 and who get a pile of cases. They don?t have a lot of time to think about art. What has changed is they have computers, and their computers have access to the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: And has that helped?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It has helped. They are willing to accept the avant-garde, but only if they can find people discussing it. So if there?s blog discussion or print discussion of our client?s work, we?re going to get an approval. If we?re relying just on testimonial letters, even letters from big people, it can be a problem. We had a great case with a letter from Roseanne Barr, but there was almost no print or blog discussion of the filmmaker, so it was denied. I think, for a young filmmaker [like him], if there are two or three blog mentions, two or three articles, plus a letter from Roseanne Barr, it would have been approved. There is a kind of consensus perception on the part of the adjudicator. If other people are talking about the artist in some kind of formal publication, it?s going to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Positive or negative discussion?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Either. I don?t think negatively matters much. If you look at the reaction to people like Tristan Tzara, going back 90 years?no one could doubt that they were making waves, and we remember them 90 years later. Today?s controversialist, tomorrow?s cliché.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s interesting that immigration officers are put in a position where they?re essentially reviewing the avant-garde. These are people who probably never expected to be in that kind of position.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: How often are they looking at people who are really pushing the envelope?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think all the time. Of course, we?re in New York. Maybe if we were in Kansas City we?d have a different perspective. Some of these cases are what we used to call ?Williamsburg? cases, but Williamsburg is becoming the mainstream. We did succeed in a permanent residence petition for a woman who dressed up in a wedding dress and stood in a store window for 12 hours. But you can?t keep winning with that. The problem is there is a kind of dilution effect that?s similar to a cute dog doing a trick for the 12th time: it becomes boring. We?ve seen some pretty extreme cases: a cake artist, who made buttocks imprints in chocolate cakes, as a statement.</p>
<p>She was actually on a TN visa as a graphic artist, and got it extended year after year. For all I know, she?s still a TN graphic artist. She had approached us several times about an EB1.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What is in the EB-1?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: An EB-1 is the extraordinary ability green card mechanism. It?s more appropriate than the national interest waiver for most artists? and entertainers? cases. We didn?t quite see the national interest waiver value of the buttocks artist, and I didn?t see the extraordinary. Had she been written up in avant-garde publications and blogs we might eventually have been able to do the case. Sometimes we just can?t quite pull it off. But as the horizons of recognized art expand, we?re considering increasingly radical, albeit meritorious, cases.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Overall, have things got easier or harder for artists looking for work permits in the United States?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think that artists have an easier time than actors. We?ve seen more willingness to tolerate the unknown in the plastic arts.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: The extraordinary ability mechanism for artists is a lower standard, and the O1 is a lower standard, significantly. Applicants only have to show that they are distinguished in the field versus extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: That?s in large part a result of the fact that so much American TV is made in Vancouver, so it?s often necessary for people to go back and forth into the U.S. Congress made the O standard intentionally easier for actors than for scientists or businessmen. So, for example, if you look at some of the cable networks like Lifetime, a substantial percentage of their original content is made in Canada, using American and Canadian actors primarily. Some of those actors have to do work in the U.S., so the O enables them to get into the U.S., having done maybe one or two TV shows in Canada. I think the O was motivated in part by the tremendous interdependence of the U.S. and Canada especially.</p>
<p>They carved out an easier path for actors because the TV industry is so desperately in need of new talent, especially from the English-speaking world.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Why do actors need an advisory opinion?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The advisory opinion goes back to the days before 1990, when artists and entertainers got H1s rather than O&#8217;s. The former INS decided that some sort of objective confirmation of eligibility was necessary to put a check on the runaway commendation and distortion sometimes present in the ensemble of reference letters usually submitted in support of artists? petitions. Originally, the pre-1991 H1 encompassed both professionals and aliens of distinguished merit. In 1990 the category was broken into two different categories, [one of] which is now the H, which is limited to 65,000 visas per year, and that?s for jobs that require a college degree, and, strangely, fashion models. The inclusion of fashion models in the H1 was the result of lobbying by Sears, because in 1990 the Sears catalogue required a huge number of models. At the time, Sears and JC Penney were major forces. When they severed the O1 from the H1 in 1990 Sears hired lobbyists to go to Washington and have fashion models put into the H1 category. I don?t think anyone looks at the Sears catalogue anymore; even in North Dakota people can order online. But remember in 1990, there was no Amazon, there was no Google, there was barely an Internet.</p>
<p>That fairly random decision has been enormously beneficial to artists, but has been tough on the tech industry. Microsoft is constantly lobbying to lift the limit of H1?s. Microsoft now has a major research establishment in Vancouver, full of Indians who don&#8217;t make the H1 cut in the US.</p>
<p>American immigration law has been largely beneficial for Canada, because the H1 numbers are exhausted in the US within a few months, and when that happens, Canada beckons. Then people wind up in Toronto or Vancouver and decide they like it better than Cleveland anyway. So it?s an interesting issue that hasn?t been explored. Canada has benefited massively from the restrictive nature of US immigration law. Canada has been very pro-technology.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Are there other areas where you feel like US immigration is too restrictive?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Canada will let people buy their way in. In the 90s, for $300,000 dollars you could have Canadian residence. That?s certainly created the multi-cultural Canada we know today, made up of middle class people that the US has turned away.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: So TN1?s make it easier for Canadians and Mexicans to work in the US right? They are the temporary visas.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They?re offered to Americans too. I could have the equivalent of a TN1 and work in Toronto as an immigration lawyer, and lots of American immigration lawyers tried that, and found that they couldn&#8217;t make enough money doing it.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Canadians are very frugal.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Right. There?s a whole different culture. Canada has a point system, so it?s kind of like a game. To get into Canada, you have to have a certain number of points. So people can kind of do it themselves.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What do you get points for?</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Age, for knowing French, for having degrees, job offers, and publications.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The US is terrified of that system. Canada really believes in objective, democratic adjudication, which would be a disaster for our industry.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Ours is based on subjectivity, that it?s all adjudicated by one person, so you have to distinctly make the argument in order to convince that person.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: But you never know who that person is going to be.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: That?s exactly right. It?s a blind system, so I think it benefits those with creativity, imagination, and dynamism. It?s certainly benefitted us, but it?s very similar to the tax system. One of the reasons it?s not going to be reformed is that there are whole industries of people making their money off their expertise navigating this system. If we had simply a flat tax based on income, an awful lot of people who make their living doing tax returns would be out of work. So the CPA firms, like the law firms, would be pretty unhappy about a simple system. There?s always going to be some degree of protectionism involved.</p>
<p>The fact is, though, I do think that the element of randomness has kind of driven the kind of creativity we have here now. We?ve benefitted from the randomness; people might not have made it on a more objective system. I think there?s an extent to which America likes the unpredictable, we embrace the unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Which is a frontier mentality, and I <em>like</em> that about America.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think if we had a totally neutral point system we would get a lot of really good people, but we would also miss some of the avant-garde people who don?t fall into traditional categories, and in the long run we lose as much as we would gain.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Because even though these categories that we?re working with are old, we still can play, we can push through, and it makes us very creative.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think that?s a big part of the whole American narrative. Canada has this kind of exaltation of democracy, and fairness, and predictability, you know, things we don?t really take seriously. We actually like the arbitrary and the random, and expect it. It actually drives our culture.</p>

Nathan is awesome. He makes immigration and paperwork sound fascinating, not frightening, and he can talk about art with the best of them. So, I figured I'd sit down with him and Susu Durst, an Extraordinary Ability Specialist who works at his firm. I asked them to get me up to speed on the lastest immigration news for artists, and chat a little about what artists need to do to immigrate to the U.S. We spoke about all that, and even ended up discussing how the differences in Canadian and American culture have informed immigration policy. It was amazing. ";s:12:"atom_content";s:18330:"<!-- array(7) {

<p>In 1999, I moved from Canada to the United States to go to grad school. As many foreign students do, I stayed  in the U.S. after I finished my degree in 2001 and thus needed a work visa.  It was around that time that I met <a href="http://www.waxlaw.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Waxman,</a> an immigration lawyer who put together the paperwork for the jobs I took.</p>
<p>Nathan is awesome. He makes immigration and paperwork sound fascinating, not frightening, and he can talk about art with the best of them. So, I figured I&#8217;d sit down with him and Susu Durst, an Extraordinary Ability Specialist who works at his firm. I asked them to get me up to speed on the lastest immigration news for artists, and chat a little about what artists need to do to immigrate to the U.S. We spoke about all that, and even ended up discussing how the differences in Canadian and American culture have informed immigration policy. It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Paddy Johnson:</strong> If you live overseas, and you?re an artist or want to work in the arts, do you think the task of getting a work visa should feel daunting to you?</p>
<p><strong>Susu Durst</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Waxman</strong>: Especially not for artists.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: We?ve done a bunch of DJ?s and musicians. It?s really only actors who have a tough time&#8230;especially stage actors.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They?ve made it easier for artists and harder for actors; that?s because actors have organizations that protect them from foreign competition. Artists Equity is particularly protectionist.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: I take it we?re talking about O visas here, visas issued for extraordinary ability.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The O is a visa for non-immigrants. In other words, it?s not a green card but it could conceivably allow artists or entertainers to remain in the U.S. indefinitely, by obtaining extensions. The initial O-1 visa may last up to three years, with the potential for indefinite extensions. Last year or the year before, there was lots of discussion about the O visa in the arts, especially acting, becoming exceptionally difficult because [Immigration] was enforcing the itinerary requirement. What this means is that Immigration wants to know what you?re actually going to be doing. The problem is, we have had actor clients who are really major, major figures and easily meet the O standard, but who don?t have any work. In the past, the O had been used as a way of coming to the U.S. to get work. Since the service has really cracked down on that, it?s been a real problem for a lot of our overseas actors. It?s the cart before the horse problem: they need to get here to audition, but if we just say they are auditioning, the case will be denied.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: The one thing that has changed in the last 6 to 9 months is that the adjudication process for O visas has been way, way faster. It only takes two weeks by regular process to get a good case through.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Two weeks? What?s changed?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I?m guessing that they hired more people, and when they run out of H?s they have lots of people left in places like Vermont who have nothing to do, so the O-1s get done quickly.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What is an H visa?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It?s a temporary professional visa for a job requiring, at minimum, a university degree. Unfortunately, it?s numerically limited and new petitions tend to be exhausted by late spring or early summer. H&#8217;s, unlike O&#8217;s, contemplate a traditional employer/employee relationship and must be compensated at appropriate US wage levels.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What about J-1s? Those are intern and student visas.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They are primarily for interns and trainees. The problem with the J-1 is that it is limited to 12 to 18 months, so by the time you?re here it?s over. And then many of those people are stranded, because there aren?t any H-1s left for someone who?s not in an H-1 position, or who just doesn?t qualify for an O. The J-1 really is relatively easy to get because of its short-term nature, but it?s not so attractive for so many people. But it certainly would be ideal for someone who just wants the experience of working in Los Angeles or New York for a year.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Does it seem like it might be a good place to get enough experience to qualify for an O?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It might be. It some cases it makes sense. If you?re Canadian you may qualify for a TN1 [a temporary work visa]. But it represents a dead end, and people on TN1 visas may wind up being stranded with no status. So we have to be cautious about recommending it to people, because once a TN?s 18 months is up, if there are no H-1s available, and the TN isn?t likely to succeed as an O-1 petitioner, there?s no way for him or her to stay, other than marriage.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: That?s really too bad.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Well, the system developed over many decades, in a random way, so that there are winners and losers and it?s never represented any kind of systematic thought; I think people being stranded is kind of inevitable, as a result of the patchwork nature of the system.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: But maybe what you?re thinking about more is artists and people in the arts, and we?ve been doing some interesting cases. Right now, we have a pending case on behalf of a girl who is supposed to be working at MoMA PS1.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Curating, and performance art. She?s a performance artist and also a curator, and we?ve received a request for additional evidence.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Which is what happened with me, when I was applying for my green card.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Right, and we responded, and it was promptly approved.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: So is that for a green card or an O visa?</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: An O visa.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: She?s kind of a junior person, she?s not quite at the seniority that you had when you applied for a green card.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: But she?s also kind of at the border of two fields, of curating and performance art. We have a chronic problem with explaining performance art to Immigration. It?s in art forms that represent a synthesis of existing media where we encounter problems. Immigration tends to think in very traditional terms of ?Well, what gallery is it in? What museum is it in? Has <em>The New York Times</em> talked about it??</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: It?s interesting that while the art world really trumpets this idea of blurring boundaries, the very things that make the arts unique and extraordinary are also the things that make an immigration case challenging.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: We?re dealing with immigration adjudicators who are generally well-meaning civil servants, but who are in little boxes, literally working in little cubicles from 8:30 to 4:30 and who get a pile of cases. They don?t have a lot of time to think about art. What has changed is they have computers, and their computers have access to the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: And has that helped?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: It has helped. They are willing to accept the avant-garde, but only if they can find people discussing it. So if there?s blog discussion or print discussion of our client?s work, we?re going to get an approval. If we?re relying just on testimonial letters, even letters from big people, it can be a problem. We had a great case with a letter from Roseanne Barr, but there was almost no print or blog discussion of the filmmaker, so it was denied. I think, for a young filmmaker [like him], if there are two or three blog mentions, two or three articles, plus a letter from Roseanne Barr, it would have been approved. There is a kind of consensus perception on the part of the adjudicator. If other people are talking about the artist in some kind of formal publication, it?s going to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Positive or negative discussion?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Either. I don?t think negatively matters much. If you look at the reaction to people like Tristan Tzara, going back 90 years?no one could doubt that they were making waves, and we remember them 90 years later. Today?s controversialist, tomorrow?s cliché.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s interesting that immigration officers are put in a position where they?re essentially reviewing the avant-garde. These are people who probably never expected to be in that kind of position.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: How often are they looking at people who are really pushing the envelope?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think all the time. Of course, we?re in New York. Maybe if we were in Kansas City we?d have a different perspective. Some of these cases are what we used to call ?Williamsburg? cases, but Williamsburg is becoming the mainstream. We did succeed in a permanent residence petition for a woman who dressed up in a wedding dress and stood in a store window for 12 hours. But you can?t keep winning with that. The problem is there is a kind of dilution effect that?s similar to a cute dog doing a trick for the 12th time: it becomes boring. We?ve seen some pretty extreme cases: a cake artist, who made buttocks imprints in chocolate cakes, as a statement.</p>
<p>She was actually on a TN visa as a graphic artist, and got it extended year after year. For all I know, she?s still a TN graphic artist. She had approached us several times about an EB1.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What is in the EB-1?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: An EB-1 is the extraordinary ability green card mechanism. It?s more appropriate than the national interest waiver for most artists? and entertainers? cases. We didn?t quite see the national interest waiver value of the buttocks artist, and I didn?t see the extraordinary. Had she been written up in avant-garde publications and blogs we might eventually have been able to do the case. Sometimes we just can?t quite pull it off. But as the horizons of recognized art expand, we?re considering increasingly radical, albeit meritorious, cases.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Overall, have things got easier or harder for artists looking for work permits in the United States?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think that artists have an easier time than actors. We?ve seen more willingness to tolerate the unknown in the plastic arts.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: The extraordinary ability mechanism for artists is a lower standard, and the O1 is a lower standard, significantly. Applicants only have to show that they are distinguished in the field versus extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: That?s in large part a result of the fact that so much American TV is made in Vancouver, so it?s often necessary for people to go back and forth into the U.S. Congress made the O standard intentionally easier for actors than for scientists or businessmen. So, for example, if you look at some of the cable networks like Lifetime, a substantial percentage of their original content is made in Canada, using American and Canadian actors primarily. Some of those actors have to do work in the U.S., so the O enables them to get into the U.S., having done maybe one or two TV shows in Canada. I think the O was motivated in part by the tremendous interdependence of the U.S. and Canada especially.</p>
<p>They carved out an easier path for actors because the TV industry is so desperately in need of new talent, especially from the English-speaking world.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Why do actors need an advisory opinion?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The advisory opinion goes back to the days before 1990, when artists and entertainers got H1s rather than O&#8217;s. The former INS decided that some sort of objective confirmation of eligibility was necessary to put a check on the runaway commendation and distortion sometimes present in the ensemble of reference letters usually submitted in support of artists? petitions. Originally, the pre-1991 H1 encompassed both professionals and aliens of distinguished merit. In 1990 the category was broken into two different categories, [one of] which is now the H, which is limited to 65,000 visas per year, and that?s for jobs that require a college degree, and, strangely, fashion models. The inclusion of fashion models in the H1 was the result of lobbying by Sears, because in 1990 the Sears catalogue required a huge number of models. At the time, Sears and JC Penney were major forces. When they severed the O1 from the H1 in 1990 Sears hired lobbyists to go to Washington and have fashion models put into the H1 category. I don?t think anyone looks at the Sears catalogue anymore; even in North Dakota people can order online. But remember in 1990, there was no Amazon, there was no Google, there was barely an Internet.</p>
<p>That fairly random decision has been enormously beneficial to artists, but has been tough on the tech industry. Microsoft is constantly lobbying to lift the limit of H1?s. Microsoft now has a major research establishment in Vancouver, full of Indians who don&#8217;t make the H1 cut in the US.</p>
<p>American immigration law has been largely beneficial for Canada, because the H1 numbers are exhausted in the US within a few months, and when that happens, Canada beckons. Then people wind up in Toronto or Vancouver and decide they like it better than Cleveland anyway. So it?s an interesting issue that hasn?t been explored. Canada has benefited massively from the restrictive nature of US immigration law. Canada has been very pro-technology.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Are there other areas where you feel like US immigration is too restrictive?</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Canada will let people buy their way in. In the 90s, for $300,000 dollars you could have Canadian residence. That?s certainly created the multi-cultural Canada we know today, made up of middle class people that the US has turned away.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: So TN1?s make it easier for Canadians and Mexicans to work in the US right? They are the temporary visas.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: They?re offered to Americans too. I could have the equivalent of a TN1 and work in Toronto as an immigration lawyer, and lots of American immigration lawyers tried that, and found that they couldn&#8217;t make enough money doing it.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: Canadians are very frugal.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: Right. There?s a whole different culture. Canada has a point system, so it?s kind of like a game. To get into Canada, you have to have a certain number of points. So people can kind of do it themselves.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: What do you get points for?</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Age, for knowing French, for having degrees, job offers, and publications.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: The US is terrified of that system. Canada really believes in objective, democratic adjudication, which would be a disaster for our industry.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Ours is based on subjectivity, that it?s all adjudicated by one person, so you have to distinctly make the argument in order to convince that person.</p>
<p><strong>PJ</strong>: But you never know who that person is going to be.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: That?s exactly right. It?s a blind system, so I think it benefits those with creativity, imagination, and dynamism. It?s certainly benefitted us, but it?s very similar to the tax system. One of the reasons it?s not going to be reformed is that there are whole industries of people making their money off their expertise navigating this system. If we had simply a flat tax based on income, an awful lot of people who make their living doing tax returns would be out of work. So the CPA firms, like the law firms, would be pretty unhappy about a simple system. There?s always going to be some degree of protectionism involved.</p>
<p>The fact is, though, I do think that the element of randomness has kind of driven the kind of creativity we have here now. We?ve benefitted from the randomness; people might not have made it on a more objective system. I think there?s an extent to which America likes the unpredictable, we embrace the unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Which is a frontier mentality, and I <em>like</em> that about America.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think if we had a totally neutral point system we would get a lot of really good people, but we would also miss some of the avant-garde people who don?t fall into traditional categories, and in the long run we lose as much as we would gain.</p>
<p><strong>SD</strong>: Because even though these categories that we?re working with are old, we still can play, we can push through, and it makes us very creative.</p>
<p><strong>NW</strong>: I think that?s a big part of the whole American narrative. Canada has this kind of exaltation of democracy, and fairness, and predictability, you know, things we don?t really take seriously. We actually like the arbitrary and the random, and expect it. It actually drives our culture.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no escaping New York. Ten minutes after arriving at <a href="http://www.artcopenhagen.dk/" target="_blank">Art Copenhagen</a> on Sunday, we encountered our boss Paddy Johnson&#8217;s face in William Powhida&#8217;s <em>Cosmology</em> (2010), a zodiac chart dividing New York art world figures into destroyers, saints, and so forth, with captions describing their roles.</p>
<p>We asked <a href="http://www.gallerypoulsen.com/" target="_blank">Gallery Poulsen</a> owner Morten Poulsen whether Art Copenhagen fair-goers get the insider jokes from a foreign art world. Most people don&#8217;t, he said, but he encourages his collectors &#8220;to do their homework.&#8221; Should they?</p>
<p>Poulsen thinks so, and like many of the dealers we spoke with, he finds Danish collectors to be overwhelmingly conservative. That might be why most of Art Copenhagen looks like an explosion of figuration. Even <a href="http://nilsstaerk.dk/" target="_blank">Nils Staerk</a>, which has a show by Brooklyn-based artist Matthew Ronay at their Carlsberg gallery, brought a smattering of straightforward figurative work to the fair. Poulsen mentioned how his artists would have been &#8220;way too figurative&#8221; to get into the more austere and abstract aesthetic of this year&#8217;s NADA New York.</p>
<p>So why the difference in taste? Part of that might lie in the desire for the market to swing back to an era before the Lehman Brothers crash, when, Poulsen told us, it seemed like the more decadent work sold all the better. &#8220;Back in 2007-2008, you had dicks and pussies just hanging out of the art. I sold 300 paintings with pussies and skulls because that&#8217;s what people wanted: sex and death. But it&#8217;s coming back,&#8221; he assured us. &#8220;And it will come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>If dicks indicate a market upswing, then Poulsen, along with a handful of other galleries, were optimistic. Looking around Art Copenhagen now, though, it seems the market mainly desires repurposed commercial packaging, gimmicky twists on figurative sculpture, and the same solid base of middling painting it always has. Basically, it looks like an art fair.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s preventing the city&#8217;s only art fair from taking off? The fair has been around since 1997, but with most of its booths populated by Copenhagen galleries, the work ends up catering to that conservative local market. The biggest roadblock to the fair&#8217;s growth lies with the city&#8217;s most international galleries; <a href="http://www.nicolaiwallner.com/index.php" target="_blank">Galleri Nicolai Wallner</a> and <a href="http://www.andersenscontemporary.dk/" target="_blank">Andersen?s Contemporary</a>, which represent artists like Elmgreen &amp; Dragset and Olafur Eliasson, respectively, both sit out the fair. Without those galleries, and the buyers they would inevitably bring, the fair misses out on an opportunity to grow its profile and its profit margins.</p>
<p>We got a curious set of responses from many dealers who told us Art Copenhagen &#8220;isn&#8217;t about selling.&#8221; A few, like Stockholm-based Galleri Andersson/Sandström, mentioned that they come back every year to connect with Danish collectors. Locals like David Risley partly came to connect with international collectors. Bo Bjerggaard of Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, one of Copenhagen&#8217;s most established modern and contemporary galleries, and which represents Jonathan Meese and Per Kirkeby, noted that sales were strong, but nothing out of the ordinary. Primarily, he said, it&#8217;s a community event.</p>
<p>The best way to gauge Art Copenhagen&#8217;s future might lie in this year?s more international and curated direction taken by the fair?s committee. At this installment, eighteen galleries were invited to present curated solo exhibitions; it&#8217;s a small gesture, but one that makes a large difference in giving off the appearance of insight and forethought, qualities not usually associated with an art fair. Geoff Newton, director of <a href="http://neonparc.com.au/" target="_blank">Neon Parc</a>, a gallery out of Melbourne, Australia, was one of those invitation-only participants. It was his first time at Art Copenhagen, and he took a more considered approach, bringing Elizabeth Newman&#8217;s pared-down collage, in part because it resonates with Danish design. Newton reported that visitors described his booth as a &#8220;breath of fresh air.&#8221; It was. Maybe the work looked more like something we&#8217;d see at NADA, but here it was a break from the mold, and it?s the type of thing that could easily draw more international attention to the fair and its smattering of Danish artists?if that&#8217;s something it wants.</p>

Part of that might lie in the desire for the market to swing back to an era before the Lehman Brothers crash, when, Poulsen told us, it seemed like the more decadent work sold all the better. &#8220;Back in 2007-2008, you had dicks and pussies just hanging out of the art. I sold 300 paintings with pussies and skulls because that&#8217;s what people wanted: sex and death. But it&#8217;s coming back,&#8221; he assured us. &#8220;And it will come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>If dicks indicate a market upswing, then Poulsen, along with a handful of other galleries, were optimistic. Looking around Art Copenhagen now, though, it seems the market mainly desires repurposed commercial packaging, gimmicky twists on figurative sculpture, and the same solid base of middling painting it always has. Basically, it looks like an art fair.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s preventing the city&#8217;s only art fair from taking off? The fair has been around since 1997, but with most of its booths populated by Copenhagen galleries, the work ends up catering to that conservative local market. The biggest roadblock to the fair&#8217;s growth lies with the city&#8217;s most international galleries; <a href="http://www.nicolaiwallner.com/index.php" target="_blank">Galleri Nicolai Wallner</a> and <a href="http://www.andersenscontemporary.dk/" target="_blank">Andersen?s Contemporary</a>, which represent artists like Elmgreen &amp; Dragset and Olafur Eliasson, respectively, both sit out the fair. Without those galleries, and the buyers they would inevitably bring, the fair misses out on an opportunity to grow its profile and its profit margins.</p>
<p>We got a curious set of responses from many dealers who told us Art Copenhagen &#8220;isn&#8217;t about selling.&#8221; A few, like Stockholm-based Galleri Andersson/Sandström, mentioned that they come back every year to connect with Danish collectors. Locals like David Risley partly came to connect with international collectors. Bo Bjerggaard of Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, one of Copenhagen&#8217;s most established modern and contemporary galleries, and which represents Jonathan Meese and Per Kirkeby, noted that sales were strong, but nothing out of the ordinary. Primarily, he said, it&#8217;s a community event.</p>
<p>The best way to gauge Art Copenhagen&#8217;s future might lie in this year?s more international and curated direction taken by the fair?s committee. At this installment, eighteen galleries were invited to present curated solo exhibitions; it&#8217;s a small gesture, but one that makes a large difference in giving off the appearance of insight and forethought, qualities not usually associated with an art fair. Geoff Newton, director of <a href="http://neonparc.com.au/" target="_blank">Neon Parc</a>, a gallery out of Melbourne, Australia, was one of those invitation-only participants. It was his first time at Art Copenhagen, and he took a more considered approach, bringing Elizabeth Newman&#8217;s pared-down collage, in part because it resonates with Danish design. Newton reported that visitors described his booth as a &#8220;breath of fresh air.&#8221; It was. Maybe the work looked more like something we&#8217;d see at NADA, but here it was a break from the mold, and it?s the type of thing that could easily draw more international attention to the fair and its smattering of Danish artists?if that&#8217;s something it wants.</p>

<p>In 2010, Susan Philipsz recorded herself singing three different versions of the 16th century Scottish lament &#8220;Lowlands Away&#8221;, and installed speakers beneath three bridges <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWeKzTDi-OA">over the River Clyde</a> in her native Glasgow to play them. It made Philipsz the first Turner Prize nominee to use sound installation, and accordingly, <em>Lowlands</em>? placement in the Turner prize exhibition was followed by an onslaught of negative criticism. The Independent?s Michael Glover called <em>Lowlands</em> ?<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/michael-glover-three-cheers-for-sound-artists-but-not-this-one-2153048.html">hype-cum hogwash</a>,? and The Telegraph?s Richard Dorment condemned those who enjoyed the piece to ?<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8186053/Turner-Prize-I-loathe-the-kind-of-think-me-sensitive-tuneless-stuff-Ms-Philipsz-sings.html">the ninth circle of art hell</a>.?</p>
<p>The most cogent reason why Philipsz?s sound art could rise above it?s haters enough to win the Turner Prize in 2010 was its fitting immersion within it?s environment. <em>Lowlands</em> was performed in a place that made sense: a Scottish folk song, directly involved with its romantic Glaswegian setting. It was evocative of time, and place; the sound felt like it belonged somewhere. By the time the critics got to it, the piece had been transferred into a gallery space, looped in an empty room at the Tate Modern. When placed in a gallery, Philipsz?s sound pieces become vacant and out of place, which is why <em>The Distant Sound</em> at <a href="http://www.tanyabonakdargallery.com/">Tanya Bonakdar</a> fails.</p>
<p>The doors of the gallery are animated by two speakers that play atonal, infrequent, and seemingly random string sounds to the passing public, attempting to invite them in with sounds that are drowned out by the West Side Highway. On entry, two adjacent walls in the main gallery space are embellished with variously sized round speakers, that again play fleeting instrumental sounds that get lost within the gallery space. The soundwalls, supposedly playing the disassembled horns, strings, and chimes from Austrian composer Franz Schreker?s 1910 opera <em>Der Ferne Klang</em>, are accompanied by a diptych of large blurred photographs of telephone lines, taken by Philipsz on a train journey from Glasgow to Dundee. A train journey from Glasgow to Dundee, coupled with isolated sounds from a 1910 Austrian opera? We don?t get it either.</p>
<p>Adjoining the main gallery space is film footage, shown on a small TV screen, capturing the slow screech of a train eventually stopping on some train tracks in Berlin. It features some more fleeting glockenspiel-esque sounds that don?t belong anywhere, or mean anything to anyone other than Philipsz. According to the exhibition?s press release, which I had to refer to in order to understand what the hell was going on here, the sounds of the train station reference the displaced emigre culture of the mid-20th century which Schreker himself was not a part of, but contemporary with. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Although Philipsz succeeds in disassembling Schreker?s score into separate instruments for every speaker to make a digital orchestra, (which is mildly exciting for sound art), there is still a major problem with <em>The Distant Sound</em>. Philipsz has brought what seems like a load of unrelated images, video and sounds into the Tanya Bonakdar hoping they?ll have some sort of dialogue, and instead they fit together as dissonantly as the shrieking violins coming from the soundwalls. If the sounds were immersed into an environment that related to Franz Schreker or his work, then the relationship created between sound and place would be kind of interesting, or at least commonsensical. It seems like the only function the soundwalls serve is to make the gallery walls ?talk? to each other, which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAsRUHyvdVk&amp;t=2m30s">isn?t challenging anybody</a>.</p>

<p>?Why Dance in The Art World?? is a good question. Though dancers and artists have worked together since forever, there are a lot of disadvantages to dancing in front of gallerygoers: Crowds are smaller, nobody knows to remember the dancers? names, and half of everything goes right over the audience?s head. Art and dance each have their specialist vocabularies, which gives any crossover both a purpose and a flaw: As an art person, I?m fascinated that dancers take classes in ?presentational aesthetics?, and I want to know more; at the same time, I have no idea what good presentational aeshetics looks like (Jeremy Barker, among others,<a href="http://www.culturebot.net/2012/05/13561/what-performance-art-can-learn-contemporary-performance-practices/">has considered these topics in depth many times</a>).

<p>Jennifer Homans, dance critic for <a href="http://www.tnr.com/users/jennifer-homans">The New Republic</a> , MoMA performance curator Jenny Schlenzka, and renowned dancer and choreographer Ralph Lemon are the right people to ask.

</div>
<p>I?m no authority on hip-hop, but there?s been a tremendous overuse of ?#swag? on Twitter in the past year. For those who are unfamiliar, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swag">?swag?</a> is short for ?swagger?­?meaning that one possesses an admirable demeanor or cool. Justin Bieber says it seven times in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GuqB1BQVr4">latest single</a>, even going so far as to say ?swaggy?, which some music journalists take as a sign that <a href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2012/03/justin_biebers_boyfriend_the_d.php">swag is now dead</a>. Bieber?s use of ?swag?, though, is no accident; the superstar is signed to a loaded recording venture between hip-hop star Usher, manager Scott ?Scooter? Braun, and Island/Def Jam Records, each of which have a direct hand in polishing his image. It?s one of many ways the language of hip hop is moving into Western youth culture.</p>
<p>Cultural studies has established that suburban white kids love hip hop in a complex manner; heaps has been written on aspiration, colorblindedness, misogynism, emulation, and subordination. But just what makes hip hop so appealing to net artists? Instead of passing off any attempt to indulge in hip hop as a 1:1 relationship between appropriation and mockery, I?m interested in looking at how different artists incorporate hip hop in their artwork to talk about themselves.</p>

<p>Anything, by and large, can be art. After Duchamp and Fluxus, the most marketable contemporary artists get away with animal cruelty (Damien Hirst), buying unusable property (Gordon Matta-Clark), and sexual ?exploitation? (Laurel Nakadate).  Art about race and racism, though, is a territory that?s not immune from moralization of the artist. In a recent Jezebel post discussing ongoing blogosphere uproar over ?<a href="http://jezebel.com/5905291/a-complete-guide-to-hipster-racism">hipster racism</a>?, Lindy West argued that:</p>
<ol>
<li>lightheartedly joking about something that draws attention to someone?s race is still a racist gesture, e.g. ?I know that you know that this joke about using chopsticks to noodles is SO Asian would be racist in the past but we?re past that because I know that you know that I?m just kidding!?</li>
<li>when white people (or any non-black person) mimic aspects of hip hop culture they are being racist, because they are intentionally mocking a Black gangster stereotype to subordinate them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can agree with the first claim. Sorry that I?m not sorry; it?s not productively funny. But according to the logic of mimicry that West described in the second, diasporic acts like Die Antwoord and Das Racist would be considered racist although they use the vocabulary of hip hop to critique the genre. Prior to this, the defamation Jack Early and Rob Pruitt received for satire of White co-optation of Black music in <em>Red, Black, Green, Red, White and Blue</em>?s first installation reflected <a href="http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32717/a-racist-show-by-pruitt-and-early-visits-the-tate-modern">kneejerk social discomfort</a> with non-Black commentary on Blackness in the media. So non-Black desire to be Black in mannerism is something that is awash in the media and everyday slang, but unspeakable in public.</p>
<p>Black artists are also <a href="http://www.theroot.com/buzz/nger-cake-lindes-race-does-not-void-outrage-0">not free from criticism</a> from accusations of ghettoizing their own culture. A recent performance of <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/04/blackface_genital_cake_sweden.php">Blackface cakecutting</a> that was orchestrated by Afro-Swedish artist Makode Aj Linde invoked criticisms of racism and sexism against Black women from mainstream news reporters and scholars. Enacted at a World Art Day celebration, the Swedish prime minister partook in cutting the nether regions of a cake in the shape of an African woman?s body. Positioned at the head, a cosmetically exaggerated ?Blackface? performer screamed while the Swedish Prime Minister cut the cake. Makode Aj Linde intended for the performance to draw awareness to female genital mutilation, but the social response to the event revealed the hypocritical power relations between Black artists and institutions. Black artists can talk about White stereotypes and treatment of Black people in a historicized manner?as a historicized discourse?but a satirical re-enactment, however empowering, is morally questionable because of its potential for literal interpretation.</p>
<p>The first artist to come to mind now when you mention hip hop and contemporary art, Hennessy Youngman, is black. Ridiculing the lofty whims of museum art in the form of the talking-head YouTube video, Jayson Musson?s persona credibly lives up to the white fantasy of the ?gangster? stereotype. However these assumptions are unseated by how acutely he can talk about academic art with street language. This tactical performance is known as strategic essentialism: performing a stereotype to disrupt existing ideas of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/09/14/an-informal-survey-of-swag-the-sociology-of-hip-hop-in-the-micro-world-of-emerging-net-art/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>Hennessy Youngman, though, was not the first to use this tactic online. Chuleta (<a href="http://wandaraimundi-ortiz.com/">Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz</a>) started doing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/nyregion/new-jersey/15artsnj.html">gallery walkthroughs</a> and art rants over a year before Youngman?s debut on YouTube, but failed to receive the same acclaim. Chuleta?s experience demonstrates how distribution on oh-so-democratic online platforms alone won?t necessarily make the common person famous. In fact, certain performed stereotypes are more fancifully validated by the art world for their potential to be ironic and funny for white gallery-going audiences.  (Recall Kalup Linzy, Vaginal Davis, or Rashaad Newsome­?all young, tokenist, intersectional queer Black artists who are often included in your typical survey show of American contemporary art!) Conversely, dissent from a bitching ?ghetto Latina? stereotype might appear less palatable to audiences unfamiliar with hip hop.</p>

<p>Geek culture and mainstream hip hop have two things in common: both are fairly male-dominated, and both are rife with misogynism. Some obtuse comparisons between net art and rap music could be best summed up by <a href="http://artschoolartcritiques.tumblr.com/post/18842534313/something-to-look-forward-to">Absis Minas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If any correlation at all can be drawn between the aesthetic sensibilities of early hip-hop and that of the burgeoning web 2.0 art community, it?s a surface one? both are small-scale, inclusive, and therefore both subject to a certain amount in-group bickering used as (and not in lieu of) artistic content?it would be a lie to say that the world did not find entertainment in the perpetual squabbling of individual rappers?it would be a larger lie to say that the world knows enough about it to bother caring.</p></blockquote>
<p>The biggest critique of emerging net art so far is its <a href="http://blogs.artinfo.com/imageconscious/2011/04/07/the-aestheticized-attention-economy-a-critical-mass-of-egos/">insularity</a> and abundant callow content. The immediacy of sharing art on social networks creates an environment of creative competition where artists keep trying to outdo each other by making the most reblogged one-liner artworks with the newest technologies.</p>
<p>This shouldn?t be surprising. From the advent of photography to the rise of online video, each challenge to art?s craft and authorship has caused it to become more self-referential. Net artists realize they are making work that?s seen by audiences with highly specific knowledge, so self-reflexivity, or a conscious extra layer of reference to one?s position, is a common tool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/09/14/an-informal-survey-of-swag-the-sociology-of-hip-hop-in-the-micro-world-of-emerging-net-art/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>For White artists working with hip-hop, this self-reflexivity is often used to address taboo. Jeremy Bailey?s practice, for instance, toys with stereotypes of the ?famous new media artist.? In a livestream performance for a <a href="http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/the-future-is-now-media-arts,-performance-and-identity-after-nam-june-paik/">Nam June Paik retrospective at the Tate Liverpool</a>, Bailey mocks masculine authorship by claiming to be the first to <a href="http://jeremybailey.net/performanceforthecomputer.html">perform for a computer</a> in the lineage of Nam June Paik, the father of video art. Hacking a Kinect to erase his own skin colour, and motion tracking his limbs with coloristic, augmented shapes, Bailey becomes a bodiless and raceless subject?a virtual body-sculpture performance. His performance addresses disjunctions between white nerd computer culture and the carnal aggression of Lil Wayne?s ?Drop the World?. As Lil Wayne declares ?<a href="http://rapgenius.com/Lil-wayne-drop-the-world-lyrics">Imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fucking head,</a>? Bailey?s bodily assemblage explodes, collapses, and disperses across the black space of the screen. A rotating image of bikini babes replaces hip hop?s formulaic video girls.</p>

<p>In a similarly self-deprecating performance, Jaakko Pallasvuo casts his queerness as out of step with the prototypical images of the ?art-fag celeb? or the nerdy new media artist. In <em>Vanilla</em> (2011) an audience claps to the beat as Pallasvuo dances hideously to ?Drop It Like It?s Hot?, rubbing vanilla ice cream over his face and body. It?s important that he?s doing this six years late; the song was hot in 2005, and here bad taste in performance meets bad taste in music. In both Pallasvuo and Bailey?s work, the absurdity of self-deprecation invokes humor, which lets viewers laugh at the artist?s self-imposed embarrassment. The same mechanism also inoculates the artist from accusations of offensiveness or irrelevance.</p>
<h2 style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #333333; font-size: 1.5em;">Swag Overload</h2>
<p>Not all artists opt for the protection of self-reference; some direct their irony outward. Glasspopcorn (Will Neibergall), whom ArtINFO has questionably called ?the Art World?s next Justin Bieber?, describes himself as an ?international superstar tween rapper? on his <a href="http://tightartists.com/glasspopcorn">Tight Artists page</a>. He?s fifteen and net famous because he is friends with Ryder Ripps and hangs out on dump.fm a lot. In line with Bailey and Pallasvuo?s methodology of satire, Glasspopcorn?s songs ?swag face? and ?Ed Hardy? recite ?swag? to the point of overkill. In ?swag face?, he consciously mocks White mimicry of mediated Black coolness, while ?Ed Hardy? works as a fanatic yet repetitive homage to the lowbrow fashion and footwear line. Jeremy Bailey and Jaakko Pallasvuo are performing self-mockery by instantiating failure to belong with rap culture, but Glasspopcorn appears as pure mockery of Black and white gangsters.</p>
<p>While Neibergall might struggle with viewers taking him seriously as a young artist performing in the shadow of Bieber, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20100760-10391698.html">CBS</a> and <a href="http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38505/the-art-worlds-justin-bieber-meet-glass-popcorn-the-15-year-old-rapper-who-rocked-ryan-trecartins-ps1-party/">ArtINFO</a> didn?t see a problem with him rapping while a plus-sized Black woman crawled around on stage at his first public appearance at <a href="http://youtu.be/lkVk0xMJur4?t=1m56s">Ryan Trecartin?s PS1 opening</a>. She might feel empowered, and undoubtedly consented to perform, but without the inoculation of reflexivity the performance looks pretty racist and sexist?not to mention sizeist. Besides Glasspopcorn?s youth, there?s little in his performance to actually challenge the ?lurid masculinity? he claims to see in mass cultural products like Monster energy drinks.</p>
<h2 style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #333333; font-size: 1.5em;">Going Shallow</h2>
<p>Often, references to hip-hop in net art are self-reflexive without being ironic, and that self-reflexivity acts as a cloak for channeling profoundly personal attractions to Black swag. For example, Robert Lorayn?s stacking videos demonstrate a skilled <a href="http://youtu.be/pNaLwUsuKzI">transformation of gang signs into dance motions</a> with his hands. Eventually none of the gestures look like gang signs, and none of the music he ?dances? to is hip hop.</p>
<p>In the work of Ann Hirsch (scandalishious), confused reflexivity plays out in exaggerated ways. Performing extremes of her personality that volley between sweet and moody, awkward and sexy, Hirsch?s dancing camwhore videos discuss the paradoxes tied to women?s sexuality on the internet: Camgirls are both lauded for their sexiness and denigrated for stupidly exposing themselves. Appearing as an alter-ego named Caroline Benton, who makes confessional vlogs and dance videos, Hirsch infuses the camgirl with humanity and quirk by dancing for the webcam in domestic settings. Whether <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQnG_cpH8gM">?exploring the dark side?</a> to witch house in her bathroom or rocking her hips to Snoop Dogg?s ?Sensual Seduction? in her kitchen, Hirsch mimics the camgirls, but also delights in the dancing. Her self-consciously sexual dancing is awkward, but also self-satisfied. Similarly, in the work of Mary Rachel Kostreva, dance expresses performative pleasure in urban music away from the club setting. When Kostreva makes videos of herself dancing to the intensely misogynist lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiIIlRBDDL4">Drake</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1BtGgc6qUk">Lil B</a> with webcam filters, her engagement is sincere.</p>
<p>Kostreva, along with Adam Harms, started <a href="http://tightartists.com/">Tight Artists</a>, a network which describes itself as ?a community of trill artists going creatively ham on the net at all times?, offering customizable HTML galleries and profiles for net artists. The network?s only rule is ?Don?t hate?.</p>
<p>In an email interview, Bailey mentioned that users enact a confused reflexivity when one sees their self-image feedback on a camera?s video preview window. Perhaps the sense of interpersonal distance offered by online profiles allows users to feel more open to trying on identities they would otherwise not act out in real life.</p>
<h2 style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #333333; font-size: 1.5em;">The Pleasures of Hip Hop</h2>
<p>Other times, artists approach hip-hop as themselves. Devin KKenny?s <em><a href="http://www.devinkenny.info/Studio-Workout">Studio Workout Vol. II</a></em> (2011), a collection of remixed songs, draws a direct line between artistic competition and hip hop culture, sprinkling its lyrics with truisms about contemporary art. KKenny highlights gaps between Black gangster culture and the professional practices of contemporary art, giving shout-outs to art critics while satirizing white male dominance in abstract painting and minimalist sculpture. Unlike Yung Jake?s consistently ironic auto-tuned commentary on the trendiness of glitch in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS7QvOX8LVk">?Datamosh?</a>, tracks like KKenny?s ?Hard in Da Paint? sound like authentic confessions of the mediocrity of being an art student.</p>
<p>Mike Ruiz?s <em>Versions Freestyle</em>, meanwhile, features the artist freestyling over Oliver Laric?s <em><a href="http://oliverlaric.com/vvversions.htm">Versions</a></em> (2010) video essay. In the original video, a computerized voice garbles about the infinite reproducibility of images as versions of reality, while carefully selected diptychs of images and footage from popular media present similar actions and scenes to show how the image is vulnerable to appropriation and doctoring in the digital age.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/09/14/an-informal-survey-of-swag-the-sociology-of-hip-hop-in-the-micro-world-of-emerging-net-art/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>Ruiz?s cover, recorded from a computer microphone, is spontaneous and amateur, to the point of appearing to ridicule Laric?s video. For Ruiz, however, freestyling is an homage that functions like sampling and remixing. His witty and incessant commentary throughout the nine-minute video demonstrates an enduring appreciation of the theoretical cruxes of the original. In an informal skype chat, Ruiz revealed he had been freestyling for fun in Austin since his teens, and found that Laric was also a prolific freestyle battler at parties in Munich. Instead of mocking swagger, the two artists share a genuine and apolitical affinity for hip hop.</p>
<h2 style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #333333; font-size: 1.5em;">Swag on Infinity</h2>
<p>Black men?s bodies and sexuality are all over the media. We have to admit we both <a href="http://www.electricprint.com/edu4/classes/readings/race_whiteyouth_blackrap.pdf">love and fear</a> ideas of the Black gangster. Black swag is fetishized, feared, appropriated, assimilated into western pop culture. It is hybridized, transformed and assimilated by users as subgenres, commodified as lifestyles and given meanings that have little to do with its history and politics. We feel alienated from rap and find the glamorization of drugs, bitches, and guns laughable; we find entertainment in what?s Other to also be cool. The culture industry and the art world alike tend to reduce their talents to <a href="http://loop21.com/life/rick-ross-hip-hop-young-black-men-trayvon">easily-digested archetypes</a>.</p>
<p>My hope is that viewers become sophisticated enough to recognize these representations and to talk back to them. We should recognize that the line between co-optation and appropriation is very fine; sometimes, an artwork may be both. It?s impossible to mark off a politically correct turf for commentary on hip hop without implicating our race and our intentions, and we should remember the importance of questioning the author?s assumptions about race and class when we encounter a work with hip hop. In the case of Lindy West: a hipster does not a young white poor creative make, and hip hop doesn?t equate to American Black culture.</p>
<p>Trying to preserve cultural sovereignty over hip-hop is a losing battle. Hip hop has become a diverse hobby for people around the world, and should be as open to cultural criticism as anything else in the public domain. When Ang Lee made <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, he stretched and queered the archetype of the American Western; was he ripping anyone off? Users are seeing opportunities to play with language in the informal space of the web, and not all of it can be read behind a lens of ?appropriation?. Appropriation is what keeps the swastika from becoming a religious symbol again, but the next guy who does a Drake cover probably just likes the music.</p>

<p>I?m no authority on hip-hop, but there?s been a tremendous overuse of ?#swag? on Twitter in the past year. For those who are unfamiliar, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swag">?swag?</a> is short for ?swagger?­?meaning that one possesses an admirable demeanor or cool. Justin Bieber says it seven times in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GuqB1BQVr4">latest single</a>, even going so far as to say ?swaggy?, which some music journalists take as a sign that <a href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2012/03/justin_biebers_boyfriend_the_d.php">swag is now dead</a>. Bieber?s use of ?swag?, though, is no accident; the superstar is signed to a loaded recording venture between hip-hop star Usher, manager Scott ?Scooter? Braun, and Island/Def Jam Records, each of which have a direct hand in polishing his image. It?s one of many ways the language of hip hop is moving into Western youth culture.</p>
<p>Cultural studies has established that suburban white kids love hip hop in a complex manner; heaps has been written on aspiration, colorblindedness, misogynism, emulation, and subordination.

<p>Anything, by and large, can be art. After Duchamp and Fluxus, the most marketable contemporary artists get away with animal cruelty (Damien Hirst), buying unusable property (Gordon Matta-Clark), and sexual ?exploitation? (Laurel Nakadate).  Art about race and racism, though, is a territory that?s not immune from moralization of the artist. In a recent Jezebel post discussing ongoing blogosphere uproar over ?<a href="http://jezebel.com/5905291/a-complete-guide-to-hipster-racism">hipster racism</a>?, Lindy West argued that:</p>
<ol>
<li>lightheartedly joking about something that draws attention to someone?s race is still a racist gesture, e.g. ?I know that you know that this joke about using chopsticks to noodles is SO Asian would be racist in the past but we?re past that because I know that you know that I?m just kidding!?</li>
<li>when white people (or any non-black person) mimic aspects of hip hop culture they are being racist, because they are intentionally mocking a Black gangster stereotype to subordinate them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can agree with the first claim. Sorry that I?m not sorry; it?s not productively funny. But according to the logic of mimicry that West described in the second, diasporic acts like Die Antwoord and Das Racist would be considered racist although they use the vocabulary of hip hop to critique the genre. Prior to this, the defamation Jack Early and Rob Pruitt received for satire of White co-optation of Black music in <em>Red, Black, Green, Red, White and Blue</em>?s first installation reflected <a href="http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32717/a-racist-show-by-pruitt-and-early-visits-the-tate-modern">kneejerk social discomfort</a> with non-Black commentary on Blackness in the media. So non-Black desire to be Black in mannerism is something that is awash in the media and everyday slang, but unspeakable in public.</p>
<p>Black artists are also <a href="http://www.theroot.com/buzz/nger-cake-lindes-race-does-not-void-outrage-0">not free from criticism</a> from accusations of ghettoizing their own culture. A recent performance of <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/04/blackface_genital_cake_sweden.php">Blackface cakecutting</a> that was orchestrated by Afro-Swedish artist Makode Aj Linde invoked criticisms of racism and sexism against Black women from mainstream news reporters and scholars. Enacted at a World Art Day celebration, the Swedish prime minister partook in cutting the nether regions of a cake in the shape of an African woman?s body. Positioned at the head, a cosmetically exaggerated ?Blackface? performer screamed while the Swedish Prime Minister cut the cake. Makode Aj Linde intended for the performance to draw awareness to female genital mutilation, but the social response to the event revealed the hypocritical power relations between Black artists and institutions. Black artists can talk about White stereotypes and treatment of Black people in a historicized manner?as a historicized discourse?but a satirical re-enactment, however empowering, is morally questionable because of its potential for literal interpretation.</p>
<p>The first artist to come to mind now when you mention hip hop and contemporary art, Hennessy Youngman, is black. Ridiculing the lofty whims of museum art in the form of the talking-head YouTube video, Jayson Musson?s persona credibly lives up to the white fantasy of the ?gangster? stereotype. However these assumptions are unseated by how acutely he can talk about academic art with street language. This tactical performance is known as strategic essentialism: performing a stereotype to disrupt existing ideas of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/09/14/an-informal-survey-of-swag-the-sociology-of-hip-hop-in-the-micro-world-of-emerging-net-art/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>Hennessy Youngman, though, was not the first to use this tactic online. Chuleta (<a href="http://wandaraimundi-ortiz.com/">Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz</a>) started doing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/nyregion/new-jersey/15artsnj.html">gallery walkthroughs</a> and art rants over a year before Youngman?s debut on YouTube, but failed to receive the same acclaim. Chuleta?s experience demonstrates how distribution on oh-so-democratic online platforms alone won?t necessarily make the common person famous. In fact, certain performed stereotypes are more fancifully validated by the art world for their potential to be ironic and funny for white gallery-going audiences.  (Recall Kalup Linzy, Vaginal Davis, or Rashaad Newsome­?all young, tokenist, intersectional queer Black artists who are often included in your typical survey show of American contemporary art!) Conversely, dissent from a bitching ?ghetto Latina? stereotype might appear less palatable to audiences unfamiliar with hip hop.</p>

<p>Not all artists opt for the protection of self-reference; some direct their irony outward.

In line with Bailey and Pallasvuo?s methodology of satire, Glasspopcorn?s songs ?swag face? and ?Ed Hardy? recite ?swag? to the point of overkill. In ?swag face?, he consciously mocks White mimicry of mediated Black coolness, while ?Ed Hardy? works as a fanatic yet repetitive homage to the lowbrow fashion and footwear line. Jeremy Bailey and Jaakko Pallasvuo are performing self-mockery by instantiating failure to belong with rap culture, but Glasspopcorn appears as pure mockery of Black and white gangsters.</p>
<p>While Neibergall might struggle with viewers taking him seriously as a young artist performing in the shadow of Bieber, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20100760-10391698.html">CBS</a> and <a href="http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38505/the-art-worlds-justin-bieber-meet-glass-popcorn-the-15-year-old-rapper-who-rocked-ryan-trecartins-ps1-party/">ArtINFO</a> didn?t see a problem with him rapping while a plus-sized Black woman crawled around on stage at his first public appearance at <a href="http://youtu.be/lkVk0xMJur4?t=1m56s">Ryan Trecartin?s PS1 opening</a>. She might feel empowered, and undoubtedly consented to perform, but without the inoculation of reflexivity the performance looks pretty racist and sexist?not to mention sizeist. Besides Glasspopcorn?s youth, there?s little in his performance to actually challenge the ?lurid masculinity? he claims to see in mass cultural products like Monster energy drinks.</p>

<p>Often, references to hip-hop in net art are self-reflexive without being ironic, and that self-reflexivity acts as a cloak for channeling profoundly personal attractions to Black swag. For example, Robert Lorayn?s stacking videos demonstrate a skilled <a href="http://youtu.be/pNaLwUsuKzI">transformation of gang signs into dance motions</a> with his hands. Eventually none of the gestures look like gang signs, and none of the music he ?dances? to is hip hop.</p>
<p>In the work of Ann Hirsch (scandalishious), confused reflexivity plays out in exaggerated ways. Performing extremes of her personality that volley between sweet and moody, awkward and sexy, Hirsch?s dancing camwhore videos discuss the paradoxes tied to women?s sexuality on the internet: Camgirls are both lauded for their sexiness and denigrated for stupidly exposing themselves. Appearing as an alter-ego named Caroline Benton, who makes confessional vlogs and dance videos, Hirsch infuses the camgirl with humanity and quirk by dancing for the webcam in domestic settings. Whether <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQnG_cpH8gM">?exploring the dark side?</a> to witch house in her bathroom or rocking her hips to Snoop Dogg?s ?Sensual Seduction? in her kitchen, Hirsch mimics the camgirls, but also delights in the dancing. Her self-consciously sexual dancing is awkward, but also self-satisfied. Similarly, in the work of Mary Rachel Kostreva, dance expresses performative pleasure in urban music away from the club setting. When Kostreva makes videos of herself dancing to the intensely misogynist lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiIIlRBDDL4">Drake</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1BtGgc6qUk">Lil B</a> with webcam filters, her engagement is sincere.</p>
<p>Kostreva, along with Adam Harms, started <a href="http://tightartists.com/">Tight Artists</a>, a network which describes itself as ?a community of trill artists going creatively ham on the net at all times?, offering customizable HTML galleries and profiles for net artists. The network?s only rule is ?Don?t hate?.</p>
<p>In an email interview, Bailey mentioned that users enact a confused reflexivity when one sees their self-image feedback on a camera?s video preview window. Perhaps the sense of interpersonal distance offered by online profiles allows users to feel more open to trying on identities they would otherwise not act out in real life.</p>

<p>Other times, artists approach hip-hop as themselves. Devin KKenny?s <em><a href="http://www.devinkenny.info/Studio-Workout">Studio Workout Vol. II</a></em> (2011), a collection of remixed songs, draws a direct line between artistic competition and hip hop culture, sprinkling its lyrics with truisms about contemporary art. KKenny highlights gaps between Black gangster culture and the professional practices of contemporary art, giving shout-outs to art critics while satirizing white male dominance in abstract painting and minimalist sculpture. Unlike Yung Jake?s consistently ironic auto-tuned commentary on the trendiness of glitch in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS7QvOX8LVk">?Datamosh?</a>, tracks like KKenny?s ?Hard in Da Paint? sound like authentic confessions of the mediocrity of being an art student.</p>
<p>Mike Ruiz?s <em>Versions Freestyle</em>, meanwhile, features the artist freestyling over Oliver Laric?s <em><a href="http://oliverlaric.com/vvversions.htm">Versions</a></em> (2010) video essay. In the original video, a computerized voice garbles about the infinite reproducibility of images as versions of reality, while carefully selected diptychs of images and footage from popular media present similar actions and scenes to show how the image is vulnerable to appropriation and doctoring in the digital age.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/09/14/an-informal-survey-of-swag-the-sociology-of-hip-hop-in-the-micro-world-of-emerging-net-art/"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p>
<p>Ruiz?s cover, recorded from a computer microphone, is spontaneous and amateur, to the point of appearing to ridicule Laric?s video. For Ruiz, however, freestyling is an homage that functions like sampling and remixing. His witty and incessant commentary throughout the nine-minute video demonstrates an enduring appreciation of the theoretical cruxes of the original. In an informal skype chat, Ruiz revealed he had been freestyling for fun in Austin since his teens, and found that Laric was also a prolific freestyle battler at parties in Munich. Instead of mocking swagger, the two artists share a genuine and apolitical affinity for hip hop.</p>

<p>Black men?s bodies and sexuality are all over the media. We have to admit we both <a href="http://www.electricprint.com/edu4/classes/readings/race_whiteyouth_blackrap.pdf">love and fear</a> ideas of the Black gangster. Black swag is fetishized, feared, appropriated, assimilated into western pop culture. It is hybridized, transformed and assimilated by users as subgenres, commodified as lifestyles and given meanings that have little to do with its history and politics. We feel alienated from rap and find the glamorization of drugs, bitches, and guns laughable; we find entertainment in what?s Other to also be cool. The culture industry and the art world alike tend to reduce their talents to <a href="http://loop21.com/life/rick-ross-hip-hop-young-black-men-trayvon">easily-digested archetypes</a>.</p>
<p>My hope is that viewers become sophisticated enough to recognize these representations and to talk back to them. We should recognize that the line between co-optation and appropriation is very fine; sometimes, an artwork may be both. It?s impossible to mark off a politically correct turf for commentary on hip hop without implicating our race and our intentions, and we should remember the importance of questioning the author?s assumptions about race and class when we encounter a work with hip hop. In the case of Lindy West: a hipster does not a young white poor creative make, and hip hop doesn?t equate to American Black culture.</p>
<p>Trying to preserve cultural sovereignty over hip-hop is a losing battle. Hip hop has become a diverse hobby for people around the world, and should be as open to cultural criticism as anything else in the public domain. When Ang Lee made <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, he stretched and queered the archetype of the American Western; was he ripping anyone off? Users are seeing opportunities to play with language in the informal space of the web, and not all of it can be read behind a lens of ?appropriation?. Appropriation is what keeps the swastika from becoming a religious symbol again, but the next guy who does a Drake cover probably just likes the music.</p>
